# found that it is not working for RDS service
 
* Shutdown is not working for a few reasons:
 
As mentioned in below documentation, 'you cannot stop and start an Aurora Serverless cluster.'

Moving ahead, you can enable auto-pause on your serverless cluster and the cluster will be paused automatically when it's idle (it has no connections). 
When database traffic resumes, Aurora automatically resumes processing capacity and scales to handle the traffic. 
Refer below documentation for more details:

Also, When the DB cluster is paused, no compute or memory activity occurs then you are charged only for storage.
